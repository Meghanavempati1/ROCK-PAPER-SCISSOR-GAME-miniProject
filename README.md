# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR-GAME-miniProject

i have created the game ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS using html, css and javascript. In  this game it reads user input from clicking one of the images (rock ,paper & scissor). Here the other player is computer ,we take input of computer from random() function in js (Math.random()*3) .every time when user clicks on one of the options then the computer selects random option among three. comparing user & computer choice ,we display the user win,loss & draw.
